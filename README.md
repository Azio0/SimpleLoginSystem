## General info
SimpleLoginSystem is built using HTML, CSS and Python. It is built as a simplistic login framework running with Flask. Easily customisable and user-friendly for any level of experience with programming. SLS has some levels of security such as preventing a user from being able to force their way to a webpage, data authentication, and error handling. However, it is recommended that you modify this to sustain the type of environment you intend to deploy it within. I do not and will not accept any liability for damage or loss of service, data or other due to failure to ensure this software adheres to regulatory requirements and environmental requirements. This project's sole purpose is to get people with lesser Python knowledge interested in development and to give them a framework to build upon.
